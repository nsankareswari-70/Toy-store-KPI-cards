What is a KPI?
KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a visual cue that displays your current performance against a target, helping you quickly assess progress toward a measurable goal. The built-in KPI visual allows you to monitor a metric (e.g., sales), compare it to a goal (e.g., target sales), and see its trend over time, providing essential data for fast, goal-oriented decision-making.

Here in this project, Total Orders By Month, Total Revenue By Month and Total Profit By Month are represented with the help of KPI cards.
